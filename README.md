## 📝 Project Description
This project implements a comprehensive backend system for a University, featuring Student Enrollment, Faculty Management, Library operations, and Departmental Budgeting.

The system is intentionally designed with complex boolean logic, mathematical accumulation, state management, and boundary conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness of **Mutation Testing**.

## 🧬 Mutation Testing Details

### What is Mutation Testing?
Mutation testing evaluates the quality of the test suite by deliberately injecting small bugs (*mutants*) into the code.  
- If a test catches it → **Mutant killed** (Good)  
- If tests pass despite the bug → **Mutant survived** (Bad)

A high kill rate indicates a strong test suite.

---

### Mutation Operators Used

1. **Conditionals Boundary Mutator**  
   Changes `<` → `<=`, `>=` → `>`, etc.  
   *Example:* Damage threshold checks in `LibraryBook`.

2. **Math Mutator**  
   Replaces arithmetic operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
   *Example:* Fine calculations in `LibrarySystem`.

3. **Negate Conditionals Mutator**  
   Negates boolean conditions.  
   *Example:* `if (isProbation)` → `if (!isProbation)`.

4. **Void Method Call Mutator**  
   Removes calls to void methods.  
   *Example:* Deletes `System.out.println` (caught by `OutputCaptureTest`).

5. **Return Values Mutator**  
   Changes return types (true/false, numeric defaults, etc.).

### Testing Levels

#### ✔ Unit Testing  
Each class (`Student`, `Faculty`, `LibraryBook`, etc.) is tested independently to verify internal logic and state transitions.

#### ✔ Integration Testing  
`EnrollmentService` tests ensure that enrollment rules (credit caps, probation blocks, capacity) work across multiple classes.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project (From Scratch)

### 1. Install Prerequisites (Java 17 + Maven)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk maven -y
````

---

### 2. Compile the Code

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

---

### 3. Run the Application (Demo Mode)

```bash
java -cp target/classes com.university.Main
```

Expected output begins with:

```
=== University System Starting ===
```

## 🤖 AI Usage Declaration

*In compliance with course rules regarding AI assistance.*

### **Tool Used:** Google Gemini

### **Contribution:**

1. Generated initial boilerplate structure for `com.university` classes.
2. Suggested creation of "Sniper" test classes like `BoundarySniperTest` and `OutputCaptureTest`.
3. Provided PITest configuration snippet for `pom.xml`.

### **Verification:**

All AI-generated content was manually validated, corrected, and expanded by both team members.
